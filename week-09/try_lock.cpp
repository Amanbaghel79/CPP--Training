/*1.we can lock multiple mutex at same time using the try_lock();
2.tries to lock all the lockable objects passed one by one in given order.
3. SYNTAX: try_lock(m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,m6).
4. on sucess return -1 , else return 0 based mutex index number which it cant lock.
5. if it fail to lock any mutex then it will release all mutex it locked before.

/*Benefits of try_lock():
 1.Non-blocking: Doesnâ€™t stall your thread.
 2.Useful for time-sensitive or UI code (e.g., games, UIs, real-time systems.
 3.Can help avoid deadlocks when trying to acquire multiple locks.
 4.You don't want your thread to get stuck waiting on a lock.
